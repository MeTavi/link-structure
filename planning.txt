Data:
date, source, target, count

How to show change over time?

- Slider for time, links change based on time?

Thresholding: take top n domains, based on count

(1) nodes color coded (e.g., liberal and affiliated sites in one color, conservative in another, news in third, social media in fourth, etc.)

(2) thickness of edge represents # of links

(3) layout the initial graph with everything (i.e., disregard temporal dimension), then fix layout

(4) have a slider bar in years: as you slide through the years, the data relevant to that year shows, everything else is hidden.


date
source
target
count

#link

date <- per link
source
target
count <- per link

#node
